## Code Styles

A few styles we follow; most of these are enforced by the Eclipse configuration described in the [Getting Started Guide](GettingStarted.md).

1. No tabs in source code. Indentation is done using 4 spaces.
1. No imports with "*".
1. The attribute `final` should be used whereever it's possible. 
1. All Java source files must have the following two lines at the top:
```
 // Copyright (c) Microsoft. All rights reserved.
 // Licensed under the MIT license. See License.txt in the project root.
```
1. We keep LF line-ending on the server. Please set the `core.safecrlf` git config property to true.
```
git config core.safecrlf true
```
